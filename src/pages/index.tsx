              This is a page where you can join/leave Interep on-chain groups
              through proof of humanity with BrightID. The current interep
              on-chain group ID is “brightidv1”, and group ID type is converted
              to uint in on-chain. <br /> Here, BrightID is currently being
              authenticated with minimal steps, and users can link their
              brightID and register for authentication on-chain. After that, you
              can join interep-brightid on-chain group.
            </div>

              (Refer to the following link for how to get Brightid verification:{" "}
              <Link href="https://brightid.gitbook.io/brightid/getting-verified">
                <a className={classes.link}>Getting-Verified</a>
              </Link>

            </div>
            <h3>Join/leave on-chain Group</h3>
            First, connect your wallet to the page and have brightid on your
            mobile phone. The step of generating a unique identifier(contextId)
            is required, currently the contextId is ETH address, and a link is
            created to register the contextId to the context(interep here). This
            link is rendered as a QR code on our page. Users can receive
            off-chain authentication by scanning the QR code with their
            brightid. Since we require on-chain authentication, users submit
            verifications signed by brightid nodes to the smart contract. If the
            user successfully registers for on-chain Bright ID authentication
            through several conditions, the user can join “brightidv1” on-chain
            group.
            <h3>Leave guestBook</h3>A user with a group membership of
            “brightidv1” can create a guestbook for the “externalNullifier”
            provided on the current page only once. The guestbook doesn't use
            its own database and gets the logged signals as events on-chain.
            (See semaphore for more information on membership proof: {" "}

            )<h3>Mint NFT</h3>A user with a group membership of “brightidv1” can
            mint the NFT badge for the group “brightidv1” only once. Please note
            that this NFT has no function and is for testing purposes only.
